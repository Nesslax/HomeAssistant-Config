# My Home Assistant Configuration
[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io)

My HA installation runs on a Pi 3 model B.

Most of it is boiler plate, but there are dynamic persistent messages based on the alert sensor from the Weather Underground component. Chromecasts also get dynamically displayed in the default view when playing.
